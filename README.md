# GA-Path-Optimising
This repository includes the implementation of a genetic algorithm for optimizing agent trajectories in confined spaces, featuring methods for trajectory analysis and effectiveness evaluation using probabilistic matrices. It also contains experimental setups for different initial agent positions to assess algorithm performance.
